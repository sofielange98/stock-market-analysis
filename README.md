The purpose of the project is to expand on and explore different techniques for applying data mining to the stock market in order to develop a strategy which can lead to profit. Four techniques will be explored - decision trees, random forest, convolutional neural networks with supervised training, and LSTM. The models were evaluated based on accuracy compared to generated labels, and also investigated as to where and when certain models may be best to apply. We also investigated how the models perform whentrained with different amounts of training data, as well as in different markets such as during a recession or in the period immediately following a recession, commonly referred to as an economic boom. Another experiment we performed with the models which hadmemory associated with them was to see how different length ofmemory affect the performance of the model.
